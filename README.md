	Cinema-going is one of the most popular out-of-home cultural activities, influencing a wide range of social, economic, and cultural phenomena in modern societies. But due to Covid-19 situation it has been more than a year since we last went to theatres to watch movies. In this project, we will be developing a movie platform management system where it will be very easy to watch and enjoy all the latest movies and tv shows just by purchasing simple subscription.

⦁	To easily watch movie from home.

⦁	Maintain movie watch list and request box.
⦁	Make sure about quality entertainment with low subscription fee.
⦁	Focus on increasing the subscribers.

User has to create an account first to watch the movies and shows. Once a user has created an account, he/she can stream.
